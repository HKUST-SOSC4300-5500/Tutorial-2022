    "- Social network simulation can be carried out to explore the network formation based on the simulation of innovation creation and knowledge diffusion in industry. \n",
    "- Simulations can be used to replicate the structural characteristics of an online discussion forum, and evaluated how different types of expert ranking algorithms may perform in communities with different characteristics \n",
    "- ABMs (Agent Based Simulation) have also been used increasingly in studying network evolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent Based Simulation:\n",
    "    - In term of social simulations, an Agent Based Model (ABM) is a computational model for studying the process of the social system as a whole through simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous individuals, known as agents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Agents can have data-gathering and decision making abilities, sometimes equipped with sophisticated learning capabilities and they can be adaptive to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Traditionally, sociologists have understood social life as a system of institutions and norms that shape individual behavior from top down. \n",
    "    - When dealing with linear systems, the behavior of the whole system corresponds exactly with the sum of its constituting parts (such as multiple regression models). \n",
    "    - In non-linear complex systems (such as online communities), even if the observer has a good understanding of how each part works, it will not be possible to understand the system as a whole\n",
    "    - Instead of starting from the system as a whole and decompose it (top-down), it will be more fruitful to start from its constitutive parts (bottom-up).\n",
    "    - In such systems, coherent system behaviors not defined a priori may spontaneously emerge from the aggregate dynamics of its components (in our case agents). \n",
